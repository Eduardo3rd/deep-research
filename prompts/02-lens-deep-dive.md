## Investment Due Diligence Lens

This phase synthesizes Phase 1 research into investment-grade analysis. Read all Phase 1 research files before starting these modules — do NOT re-research company basics. Instead, analyze, compare, model, and evaluate.

Your analysis must meet the standards expected by:
- A growth equity fund considering a $50-100M investment
- A strategic acquirer preparing a $500M+ acquisition offer
- A public market analyst initiating coverage with a price target
- A board member evaluating competitive positioning
